Mitigation is a long-term solution, but it’s not forever—like any tool, it requires maintenance and regular checks. Fans may degrade, and soil shifts can alter radon levels. Retest every two years or use a continuous monitor for safety. Talk to your radon mitigation professional to understand expected radon levels and when to call for service."

A one-time test doesn’t reflect long-term radon exposure, as levels fluctuate due to temperature changes, soil conditions, weather conditions, and structural changes. If testing was done in a warmer month, radon levels may have been lower. To ensure ongoing safety, use a continuous radon monitor or retest at least every two years."

The state’s average radon level is 6.8 pCi/L—2.8 times higher than the EPA’s action level of 4.0 pCi/L. With over 50% of homes exceeding this threshold, continuous radon monitoring and professional mitigation are essential for long-term safety."

Cities with particularly high radon levels include Boulder, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs, and Denver. However, due to Colorado’s uranium-rich soil, any home in the state can be at risk, making ongoing radon testing essential."

Because children have smaller lungs and breathe more air relative to their size, they are more vulnerable to radon’s harmful effects. Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. among non-smokers, making it a significant health risk for families."
